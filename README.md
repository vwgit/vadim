# About me
## My name is Vadim. I'm 20 years old, and I'm currently a first-year student at a technical university. 
I'm really interested in learning to program in:
- C++;
- Python;
- and 1C.

When I finished college, I wrote a letter-learning program for kids called "Smart Speech Therapist" in C# on the Windows Forms platform. 

I was working on a university term project, and I decided to try my hand at 3D modeling. I'm so glad you asked about the logo! It was a real treat. The output was a 3D movie on the theme of the airline logo, lasting about two minutes. That was so funny! ðŸ˜„

I'm currently learning about the development of application solutions in the language of the 1C:Enterprise program.
